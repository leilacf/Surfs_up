# Surfs_up
## Overview
We worked closely with W. Avy in establishing a business plan for the opening of a Surf 'n Shake shop, serving surfboards and ice cream to the local community. The idea was deemed a success, however, there was one primary concern in the way: the volatility of the weather. When establishing a shop which at its core, is based heavily on sunny days, the weather could drastically impact profits. W. Avy had previous experience with another surf shop that had been rained out of existence--therefore, with this knowledge, he asked us to run analytics on a weather data set he had, set on the island in which we wanted to open the shop. The purpose of this project was to understand and dissect temperature and weather trends, specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be a sustainable year-round venture.

## Results
We used Jupyter Notebook with Python coding, and SQLAlchemy to query the Hawaii SQLite dataset.
From our analysis, below are the tables of the summary statistics for the months of June and Decemeber:
